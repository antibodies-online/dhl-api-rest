This package provides PHP classes to interact with the DHL REST API.

Each Class is generated by Jane OpenAPI Generator. The OpenAPI Specification is provided by FedEx which can be found in the resources folder.

## Installation

```shell
composer require antibodies-online/dhl-api-rest
```

## Usage

TBC

## Development

### Combine OpenAPI Specification json files
```shell
composer build-combined-json
```
> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful, the track json contains an operation with numbers. This will break the function names in the Client. You have to rewrite the name to: "Track Send Notification"!

### Generate Classes
```shell
composer openapi-generate
```
